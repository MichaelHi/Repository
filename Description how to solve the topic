The facebook-like-button-flyout lies behind the "Have-you-seen?"-box, but it is meant to lie in front.

The "Have-you-seen?"-box has the z-index:2.
For facebook-like-button-flyout I couldn't find an z-index.

I was able to fix the bug, by adding

z-index:3;

to oxid.css, when it comes to .social span. Like this:

.social span {
    float: left;
    z-index:3;
}
